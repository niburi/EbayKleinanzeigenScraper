Scraping with Levenshtein Distance text analysis 

This python script allows you to scrape all articles of a specific kind of category for word similarities.
I implemented the Levenshtein Distance which gives you the amout of operations to change word a to word b:
For example "tets" could be "test" with 2 operations (tets -> tess -> test ).  

Please dont use that code to scam people! This codeÂ´s purpose is to implement a full text search to this webside.
